# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering occurs after data collection and preprocessing.

You engineer the features from the raw data to get a format of data computable by machines. For more you can read about data computability.

Prerequisites: 

Linear Algebra (Dimensions, features as mappings)- More specificially you should study seeing features as dimensions in a multidimensional vector space. Obviously, we care about computability, hence we really want a quickly computable vector. We do this through dimensionality reduction, eg. PCA.

Statistics (feature quality)- Understanding data distributions helps in creating meaningful features, you have to do EDA to really extract anything. We achieve this through statistical measures and concepts. 

Calculus (feature selection)- feature selection techniques involve optimization and gradient descent at times.
